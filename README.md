# Complete-Web-Dev-Bootcamp

In this project repository, I've included the coding exercises completed during "The Complete Web Development Bootcamp 2024" course, alongside the guidance of the instructor. You can access the course on Udemy at the following link: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=LEADERSALE24A

Within each folder, you'll find an index file containing my code, along with a goal PNG or file detailing the objectives for the code. These resources are invaluable for anyone interested in learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and other essential web development technologies.

Feel free to explore these materials if you're eager to enhance your skills in web development. They provide hands-on experience and practical insights that are crucial for mastering these technologies.
